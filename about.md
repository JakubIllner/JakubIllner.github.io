![Intro Picture](/images/about/mulhacen.JPG)

I designed my first data warehouse in 1999. Since then I was involved in dozens large scale data management projects, mostly in the role of solution architect, analyst, designer, and data modeler.

I grew up on Oracle database and integration products, and later expanded the skills to big data, event processing, and cloud native technologies. Over the time I learned that successful systems must address not just data itself, but also master data, information lifecycle, ownership, security, and operations. In short, the whole data ecosystem.

I quickly realized that one must talk with end users, take in the business models and processes, and structure the architecture around business needs and not the other way around. And that it helps if one knows what banking, communications, travel, healthcare and other industry domains are about. 

But this blog is not about my achievements.

It is about questions, solutions, and ideas in the data management I encountered. About solutions I tried (or not) and which I believe are important for others.

Please do not take any information in this blog for granted. Everything I write has its context which might not be applicable in your case. I try to verify the information I present but I make mistakes and have my own beliefs.

I am also biased by my long work at Oracle. Oracle had its ups and downs but I believe it has excellent products; such as Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), Autonomous Database, or CX and ERP applications. The solutions I present are demonstrated on Oracle technologies.

Please note that although I  work for Oracle, the views expressed on this blog are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of Oracle.

I hope you find this blog useful.
